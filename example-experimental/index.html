    <p>This example subscribes to unconfirmed transactions in a web worker 
        and passes them back to the main window.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Support for loading ES5 modules outside of the "main" browser
            context is only supported in Chrome 80+, so although it may give you a worker
            that doesn't block the main thread, it might not be a good idea in 2020.
            This feature is (maybe) being added by firefox and maybe safari.
